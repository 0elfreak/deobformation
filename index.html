    <h3>How we combat desinformation and provide better results ?
        <br>
        Duplicate Content—If multiple documents contain the same information, then only the most relevant document of that set is included in your search results.
<br>
Host Crowding—If there are many search results from the same site, we may not show all the results from that site or may show the results lower in
the ranking than they otherwise would have been
